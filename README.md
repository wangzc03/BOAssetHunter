# RO2-Asset-Hunter
This is an RS2/RO2/BO asset finder based on AI-Embedding. You simply input what you want (e.g., "jungle leaves," "rusty iron gate"), and the AI ​​will immediately tell you which UPK package it's in and its name. By quickly finding assets through descriptive features, it significantly improves map creation efficiency.
